# Continuous, rapid, NixOS deployments to Amazon Web Services  üöÄ

This project shows you how to continuously deploy a [NixOS] configuration to an Amazon Web Services (AWS) [EC2 instance][ec2] using [Terraform] and [FlakeHub] _in seconds_ Ô∏è‚è±Ô∏è

- **The initial deployment completes in _less than 60 seconds_**
- **Subsequent deployments take _less than 10 seconds_**

The deployment process involves fetching a pre-built NixOS [closure][closures] from [FlakeHub] and applying it to the [EC2] instance, streamlining the deployment process and ensuring consistency across deployments.
[Amazon Systems Manager][asm] agent is used for secure, efficient, and automated deployments, eliminating the need for SSH access and simplifying operations.

## Run the demo deployment

[EtherCalc]

You can run this demo either [locally](#run-it-locally) on your machine or on [GitHub Actions](#run-it-in-github-actions).

> [!TIP]
> For a full rundown of how everything in the demo works, see [What's in the demo](#whats-in-the-demo) below.

### Run it locally

In order to run the demo locally, you'll need an AWS account

```shell
# Enter the setup directory and initialize your OpenTofu providers
cd setup
tofu init

# Validate your Terraform configuration
tofu validate

# Apply the configuration to create the necessary resources
tofu apply -auto-approve

# See which types of resources you've created
cat terraform.tfstate | jq '.resources[].type'

# Set some environment variables from the OpenTofu output
export ETHERCALC_NIXOS_FLAKE_REF="$(tofu output --json | jq -r .flake_reference.value).config.system.build.toplevel"
export ETHERCALC_WEBSITE=$(tofu output --json | jq -r .website.value)

# Your EC2 instance has been created but the NixOS configuration hasn't yet been applied
# This command applies it using the fh CLI tool
aws ssm send-command \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --targets Key=tag:Name,Values=FlakeHubDemo \
  --document-name "FlakeHub-ApplyNixOS" \
  --parameters flakeref="${ETHERCALC_NIXOS_FLAKE_REF}"

# Open the website for the ethercalc service running on EC2
open "${ETHERCALC_WEBSITE}"

# You'll likely need to wait about a minute or so for the site to become available

# When you're done, make sure to destroy your created resources
tofu destroy -auto-approve
```

### Run it GitHub Actions

To run the demo in [GitHub Actions][actions], you can copy the [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) file in this repo into one of your own repos.

Here, we'll break down the workflow configuration piece by piece.
First, some standard setup:

```yaml
# When to trigger
on:
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - master
    tags:
      - "v?[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+*"

# Concurrency config for the Action
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

In the first workflow job, build the [EtherCalc] NixOS closure and push it to [FlakeHub Cache][cache]:

```yaml
jobs:
  # Build the NixOS configuration for EtherCalc and push it to FlakeHub Cache
  build-publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      flakeref-exact: ${{ steps.flakehub-push.outputs.flakeref-exact }}
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Install Nix
      - uses: DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@main
        with:
          flakehub: true

      # Set up FlakeHub Cache using the Magic Nix Cache
      - uses: DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache-action@main

      # Build the closure, which is automatically pushed to FlakeHub Cache
      - name: Build NixOS closure
        run: |
          nix build .#nixosConfigurations.ethercalc-demo.config.system.build.toplevel

      # Publish the flake to FlakeHub
      - uses: DeterminateSystems/flakehub-push@main
        id: flakehub-push
        with:
          name: DeterminateSystems/demo
          rolling: true
          visibility: private
          include-output-paths: true
```

Then deploy

```yaml
jobs:
  build-publish: # see above

  # Deploy the image to AWS
  deploy:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: build-publish
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: "write"
      contents: "read"
    steps:
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
        with:
          aws-region: us-east-2
          role-to-assume: arn:aws:iam::194722411868:role/github-actions/FlakeHubDeployDemo

      # Use Amazon Systems Manager to trigger an application of the NixOS configuration
      - name: Deploy EtherCalc
        run: |
          aws ssm send-command \
            --region us-east-2 \
            --targets Key=tag:Name,Values=FlakeHubDemo \
            --document-name "FlakeHub-ApplyNixOS" \
            --parameters flakeref="${{ needs.build-publish.outputs.flakeref-exact }}#nixosConfigurations.ethercalc-demo"
```

## What's in the demo

This demonstration project consists of the following key components:

- **Nix [flake][flakes] configuration**: A Nix flake configuration that defines the NixOS configuration for the deployment target.
- **Terraform configuration**: A Terraform configuration that sets up an AWS EC2 instance and deploys the NixOS configuration using [FlakeHub].
  - **User Data script**: A script that runs on the EC2 instance to authenticate with [FlakeHub] and apply the NixOS configuration.
- **GitHub Actions workflow**: A GitHub Actions workflow that triggers the deployment process using Terraform and [FlakeHub].
  - **Triggering rollbacks**: Demonstrates how to use the `workflow_dispatch` event to manually trigger a workflow run, enabling rollbacks to previous stable states.

### Nix flake Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è

The [`flake.nix`](./flake.nix) sets up a NixOS configuration with specific dependencies and system packages for the demo system.

- **Inputs:** Specifies dependencies from external sources:
  - `nixpkgs`: Nixpkgs flake from FlakeHub.
  - `determinate`: Determinate flake from FlakeHub.
  - `fh`: [FlakeHub client][fh] flake from FlakeHub.
- **Outputs:** Defines the outputs of the flake:
  - `nixosConfigurations.ethercalc-demo`: A NixOS configuration for the system.
  - Includes modules from `nixpkgs` and `determinate`.
  - Defines system packages, including a package from `fh`.
  - Importantly, **the Amazon Systems Manager agent is included**.

#### Amazon Systems Manager agent Ô∏èüéõÔ∏è

Deploying NixOS AMIs using Amazon Systems Manager agent offers several advantages over traditional SSH-based deployments, especially for enterprise environments prioritizing security and automation:

- **Enhanced security:**
  - No need to expose SSH ports, reducing attack surface
  - Eliminates management of SSH keys
  - Use [AWS IAM][iam] for access control
- **Improved compliance:**
  - Centralized logging of all actions through AWS CloudTrail
  - Easier to meet regulatory requirements with built-in audit trails
- **Streamlined operations:**
  - Consistent management interface across EC2 instances
  - Simplified access for operations teams without direct SSH access
- **Automation-friendly:**
  - Native integration with other AWS services
  - Easier to incorporate into CI/CD pipelines and GitOps workflows
- **Scalability:**
  - Better suited for managing large fleets of instances
  - Reduces operational overhead as infrastructure grows
- **Increased reliability:**
  - Amazon Systems Manager agent can automatically update itself
  - More resilient to network issues than SSH
- **Fine-grained access control:**
  - Ability to grant temporary, limited access to specific instances
  - Easier to implement principle of least privilege

By leveraging Amazon Systems Manager, enterprises can create a more secure, compliant, and efficient deployment pipeline for NixOS AMIs, aligning with best practices for cloud operations and security.

### Terraform configuration Ô∏è‚õ∞Ô∏è

The [`main.tf`](./setup/main.tf) file is a Terraform configuration that sets up an AWS EC2 instance with the following components:

- *Data Source:* `aws_ami.nixos`
  - Fetches the most recent AMI provided by Determinate Systems (535002876703).
- *Resource:* `aws_instance.demo`
  - Creates an EC2 instance using the fetched AMI.
  - Configures the instance with:
    - Public IP address association.
    - Instance type `t3a.nano`.
    - Security group ID from `aws_security_group.demo`.
    - Key name from `aws_key_pair.deployer`.
    - Subnet ID from `aws_subnet.main`.
    - [AWS IAM][iam] instance profile `flakehub_client_machine`.
    - User data script for initialization.

#### User Data script Ô∏èüìú

The `user_data` portion in the `aws_instance` resource is a script that runs when the EC2 instance is first launched. This script performs the following actions:

- **Login command:** `determinate-nixd login aws`
  - Authenticates the Determinate Nix daemon using AWS credentials and sets up the environment for further [FlakeHub] operations.
- **Apply NixOS configuration:** `fh apply nixos ${var.flake_reference}`
  - Uses the [FlakeHub client][fh] command `fh` to apply a NixOS configuration specified by the `${var.flake_reference}` variable which is defined in the [`vars.local.auto.tfvars`](./setup/vars.local.auto.tfvars) file, and points to a specific NixOS flake reference.

The `user_data` steps in the [`main.tf`](./setup/main.tf) simplify the process of authentication and applying the system configuration in the following ways:

##### Simple authentication üîë

`determinate-nixd` authenticates with FlakeHub using the machines' assumed role.
The [only requirement is the machine *have a role*, and for FlakeHub to know what that role is][sts-doc].
This role grants no privileges until you set `deploy_from_github = true` in [`vars.local.auto.tfvars`](./setup/vars.local.auto.tfvars).

1. **Using `determinate-nixd login aws`**:
   - **Automatic authentication**: The `determinate-nixd login aws` command handles the authentication to the [FlakeHub] cache and sources using AWS credentials, removing the complexity of manually managing and sharing credentials.
   - **Security**: By using the Determinate Nix daemon, sensitive AWS credentials do not need to be explicitly shared or embedded in the deployment target, reducing the risk of credential leakage and simplifies credential management.

##### Simplified & faster deployment üöÄ

2. **Using `fh apply nixos ${var.flake_reference}`**:
   - **Single command deployment**: The `fh apply nixos` command resolves and activates the NixOS configuration in one step, it fetches the pre-evaluated NixOS closure referenced by `${var.flake_reference}`.
   - **Efficiency**: Since the closure is pre-evaluated, the command does not need to perform the evaluation and build steps on the deployment target which significantly reduces the time and computational resources required for deployment.

### GitHub actions workflow üêô

This `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow is configured to run on three types of events: `pull_request`, `workflow_dispatch`, and `push` to specific branches (`main` and `master`) or tags matching a version pattern (`v?[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+*`).

Checks out the repository using `actions/checkout@v4` and installs Nix using `DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@main` with `flakehubpush` enabled so the outputs are cached.

The `Deploy` step in the GitHub Actions workflow is responsible for deploying the application to AWS. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

- **Configure AWS credentials**:
  - Uses the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4` action to configure AWS credentials.
  - Specifies the AWS region (`us-east-2`) and the [IAM] role to assume (`arn:aws:iam::194722411868:role/github-actions/FlakeHubDeployDemo`).

- **Deploy Ethercalc**:
  - Runs an Amazon Systems Manager to deploy the application.
  - Uses the `aws ssm send-command` to send a command to instances tagged with `Name=FlakeHubDemo`.
  - Specifies the Systems Manager document name (`FlakeHub-ApplyNixOS`) and passes the `flakeref` parameter, which includes the exact flake reference from the `BuildPublish` job's output.

In a matter of seconds, the GitHub Actions workflow deploys the NixOS configuration to the AWS EC2 instance, demonstrating the speed and efficiency of the deployment process.

#### Continuous deployment Ô∏è‚ôªÔ∏è

This GitHub Actions workflow enables continuous deployment of the NixOS configuration to the AWS EC2 instance whenever changes are pushed to the repository or a pull request is merged.

Continuous deployments can be demonstrated by toggling the `enable` state of `services.ethercalc` and `services.writefreely` in `flake.nix` and then pushing the changes or merging a pull request.
This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow, which will deploy the changes automatically and the changes will be reflected on the AWS EC2 instance with chosen service listening on port 80.

#### Triggering rollbacks üí•

The `workflow_dispatch` event in GitHub Actions allows you to manually trigger a workflow run. This can be particularly useful for handling rollbacks, as it enables you to execute a predefined set of steps to revert to a previous stable state of your application.

## Summary ü§î

Applying fully evaluated NixOS closures via [FlakeHub] differs from typical deployments using Nix in several key ways, leading to improvements in speed, simplicity and security:

### Security

- **FlakeHub deployment:** Uses [Amazon Systems Manager][asm] for secure, auditable access without exposing SSH ports.
  Credentials are managed through IAM roles, eliminating the need for static SSH keys.
  This approach aligns with zero-trust security models and simplifies compliance in regulated environments.
- **Typical Nix deployment:** Often relies on SSH for access, requiring management of SSH keys and potential exposure of ports to the internet.
  This increases the attack surface and complicates security audits. Key rotation and access control become ongoing operational challenges, especially in large-scale deployments.

### Deployment speed

- **FlakeHub deployment:** The NixOS configuration is evaluated and built ahead of time. As the closure is pre-built, and cached, the deployment process is faster. The EC2 instance only needs to download and apply the pre-built closure, eradicating the time spent on evaluation and building.
- **Typical Nix deployment:** The evaluation and build process happens during the deployment, which can be time-consuming. The instance, or intermediate deployment host, must evaluate the Nix expressions and build the necessary packages during deployment, which can significantly increase the deployment time.

#### Resource utilization

- **FlakeHub deployment:** Offloads the computationally intensive tasks of evaluation and building to a more controlled environment (e.g., a CI/CD pipeline), freeing up resources on the target EC2 instance.
- **Typical Nix deployment:** The target EC2 instance must handle the evaluation and build process, which can be resource-intensive and may require larger instance types or longer deployment times. Or the evaluation and build process must be done on a separate host, which adds complexity to the deployment process.

#### Scalability for auto-scaled workloads

- **FlakeHub deployment:** The pre-built and cached nature of FlakeHub deployments allows for rapid instance provisioning, making it ideal for auto-scaling scenarios. New instances can quickly download and apply the pre-built configuration, enabling faster scale-out responses to demand spikes.
- **Typical Nix deployment:** The time required for evaluation and building on each new instance can introduce significant delays in auto-scaling responsiveness. This lag may result in suboptimal resource utilization during demand fluctuations and could impact application performance during scale-out events.

In summary, applying a fully evaluated NixOS closure from [FlakeHub] during deployments ensures that the exact same configuration is deployed every time, as the closure is a fixed, immutable artifact.
It also leads to faster deployments (and rollback *when required*) by pre-evaluating and pre-building the NixOS configuration, thus offloading the heavy lifting from the deployment phase to CI/CD.
