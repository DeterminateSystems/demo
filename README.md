# Introduction

This demonstration project consists of the following key components:

- **Nix Flake configuration**: A Nix flake configuration that defines the NixOS configuration for the deployment target.
- **Terraform configuration**: A Terraform configuration that sets up an AWS EC2 instance and deploys the NixOS configuration using [FlakeHub](https://flakehub.com).
  - **User Data script**: A script that runs on the EC2 instance to authenticate with [FlakeHub](https://flakehub.com) and apply the NixOS configuration.
- **GitHub Actions workflow**: A GitHub Actions workflow that triggers the deployment process using Terraform and [FlakeHub](https://flakehub.com).
  - **Triggering rollbacks**: Demonstrates how to use the `workflow_dispatch` event to manually trigger a workflow run, enabling rollbacks to previous stable states.

## Nix flake Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è

The `flake.nix` sets up a NixOS configuration with specific dependencies and system packages for the demo system.

- **Inputs:** Specifies dependencies from external sources:
  - `nixpkgs`: Nixpkgs flake from FlakeHub.
  - `determinate`: Determinate flake from FlakeHub.
  - `fh`: [FlakeHub client](https://github.com/determinatesystems/fh) flake from FlakeHub.
- **Outputs:** Defines the outputs of the flake:
  - `nixosConfigurations.ethercalc-demo`: A NixOS configuration for the system.
  - Includes modules from `nixpkgs` and `determinate`.
  - Defines system packages, including a package from `fh`.
  - Importantly, **Amazon Simple Systems Manager (SSM) agent is included**.

### Amazon Simple Systems Manager (SSM) agent Ô∏èüéõÔ∏è

Deploying NixOS AMIs using Amazon SSM agent offers several advantages over traditional SSH-based deployments, especially for enterprise environments prioritizing security and automation:

- **Enhanced security:**
  - No need to expose SSH ports, reducing attack surface
  - Eliminates management of SSH keys
  - Leverages AWS IAM for access control
- **Improved compliance:**
  - Centralized logging of all actions through AWS CloudTrail
  - Easier to meet regulatory requirements with built-in audit trails
- **Streamlined operations:**
  - Consistent management interface across EC2 instances
  - Simplified access for operations teams without direct SSH access
- **Automation-friendly:**
  - Native integration with other AWS services
  - Easier to incorporate into CI/CD pipelines and GitOps workflows
- **Scalability:**
  - Better suited for managing large fleets of instances
  - Reduces operational overhead as infrastructure grows
- **Increased reliability:**
  - SSM agent can automatically update itself
  - More resilient to network issues than SSH
- **Fine-grained access control:**
  - Ability to grant temporary, limited access to specific instances
  - Easier to implement principle of least privilege

By leveraging SSM, enterprises can create a more secure, compliant, and efficient deployment pipeline for NixOS AMIs, aligning with best practices for cloud operations and security.

## Terraform configuration Ô∏è‚õ∞Ô∏è

The `main.tf` file is a Terraform configuration that sets up an AWS EC2 instance with the following components:

- *Data Source:* `aws_ami.nixos`
  - Fetches the most recent AMI provided by Determinate Systems (535002876703).
- *Resource:* `aws_instance.demo`
  - Creates an EC2 instance using the fetched AMI.
  - Configures the instance with:
    - Public IP address association.
    - Instance type `t3a.nano`.
    - Security group ID from `aws_security_group.demo`.
    - Key name from `aws_key_pair.deployer`.
    - Subnet ID from `aws_subnet.main`.
    - IAM instance profile `flakehub_client_machine`.
    - User data script for initialization.

### User Data script Ô∏èüìú

The `user_data` portion in the `aws_instance` resource is a script that runs when the EC2 instance is first launched. This script performs the following actions:

- **Login command:** `determinate-nixd login aws`
  - Authenticates the Determinate Nix daemon using AWS credentials and sets up the environment for further [FlakeHub](https://flakehub.com) operations.
- **Apply NixOS configuration:** `fh apply nixos ${var.flake_reference}`
  - Uses the [FlakeHub client](https://github.com/determinatesystems/fh) command `fh` to apply a NixOS configuration specified by the `${var.flake_reference}` variable which is defined in the `vars.local.auto.tfvars` file, and points to a specific NixOS flake reference.

The `user_data` steps in the `main.tf` simplify the process of authentication and applying the system configuration in the following ways:

#### Simple authentication üîë

`determinate-nixd` authenticates with FlakeHub using the machines' assumed role.
The [only requirement is the machine *have a role*, and for FlakeHub to know what that role is](https://learn.determinate.systems/advanced/log-in-with-aws-sts).
This role grants no privileges until you set `deploy_from_github = true` in `vars.local.auto.tfvars`

1. **Using `determinate-nixd login aws`**:
   - **Automatic authentication**: The `determinate-nixd login aws` command handles the authentication to the [FlakeHub](https://flakehub.com) cache and sources using AWS credentials, removing the complexity of manually managing and sharing credentials.
   - **Security**: By using the Determinate Nix daemon, sensitive AWS credentials do not need to be explicitly shared or embedded in the deployment target, reducing the risk of credential leakage and simplifies credential management.

#### Simplified & faster deployment üöÄ

2. **Using `fh apply nixos ${var.flake_reference}`**:
   - **Single command deployment**: The `fh apply nixos` command resolves and activates the NixOS configuration in one step, it fetches the pre-evaluated NixOS closure referenced by `${var.flake_reference}`.
   - **Efficiency**: Since the closure is pre-evaluated, the command does not need to perform the evaluation and build steps on the deployment target which significantly reduces the time and computational resources required for deployment.

## GitHub actions workflow üêô

This `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow is configured to run on three types of events: `pull_request`, `workflow_dispatch`, and `push` to specific branches (`main` and `master`) or tags matching a version pattern (`v?[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+*`).

Checks out the repository using `actions/checkout@v4` and installs Nix using `DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@main` with `flakehubpush` enabled so the outputs are cached.

The `Deploy` step in the GitHub Actions workflow is responsible for deploying the application to AWS. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

- **Configure AWS credentials**:
  - Uses the `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4` action to configure AWS credentials.
  - Specifies the AWS region (`us-east-2`) and the IAM role to assume (`arn:aws:iam::194722411868:role/github-actions/FlakeHubDeployDemo`).

- **Deploy Ethercalc**:
  - Runs an AWS Simple Systems Manager (SSM) to deploy the application.
  - Uses the `aws ssm send-command` to send a command to instances tagged with `Name=FlakeHubDemo`.
  - Specifies the SSM document name (`FlakeHub-ApplyNixOS`) and passes the `flakeref` parameter, which includes the exact flake reference from the `BuildPublish` job's output.

In a matter of seconds, the GitHub Actions workflow deploys the NixOS configuration to the AWS EC2 instance, demonstrating the speed and efficiency of the deployment process.

### Continuous deployment Ô∏è‚ôªÔ∏è

This GitHub Actions workflow enables continuous deployment of the NixOS configuration to the AWS EC2 instance whenever changes are pushed to the repository or a pull request is merged.

Continuous deployments can be demonstrated by toggling the `enable` state of `services.ethercalc` and `services.writefreely` in `flake.nix` and then pushing the changes or merging a pull request.
This will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow, which will deploy the changes automatically and the changes will be reflected on the AWS EC2 instance with chosen service listening on port 80.

### Triggering rollbacks üí•

The `workflow_dispatch` event in GitHub Actions allows you to manually trigger a workflow run. This can be particularly useful for handling rollbacks, as it enables you to execute a predefined set of steps to revert to a previous stable state of your application.

# Summary ü§î

Applying fully evaluated NixOS closures via [FlakeHub](https://flakehub.com) differs from typical deployments using Nix in several key ways, leading to improvements in speed, simplicity and security:

## Security
- **FlakeHub deployment:** Leverages AWS Simple Systems Manager (SSM) for secure, auditable access without exposing SSH ports. Credentials are managed through IAM roles, eliminating the need for static SSH keys. This approach aligns with zero-trust security models and simplifies compliance in regulated environments.
- **Typical Nix deployment:** Often relies on SSH for access, requiring management of SSH keys and potential exposure of ports to the internet. This increases the attack surface and complicates security audits. Key rotation and access control become ongoing operational challenges, especially in large-scale deployments.

## Deployment speed
- **FlakeHub deployment:** The NixOS configuration is evaluated and built ahead of time. As the closure is pre-built, and cached, the deployment process is faster. The EC2 instance only needs to download and apply the pre-built closure, eradicating the time spent on evaluation and building.
- **Typical Nix deployment:** The evaluation and build process happens during the deployment, which can be time-consuming. The instance, or intermediate deployment host, must evaluate the Nix expressions and build the necessary packages during deployment, which can significantly increase the deployment time.

### Resource utilization
- **FlakeHub deployment:** Offloads the computationally intensive tasks of evaluation and building to a more controlled environment (e.g., a CI/CD pipeline), freeing up resources on the target EC2 instance.
- **Typical Nix deployment:** The target EC2 instance must handle the evaluation and build process, which can be resource-intensive and may require larger instance types or longer deployment times. Or the evaluation and build process must be done on a separate host, which adds complexity to the deployment process.

### Scalability for auto-scaled workloads
- **FlakeHub deployment:** The pre-built and cached nature of FlakeHub deployments allows for rapid instance provisioning, making it ideal for auto-scaling scenarios. New instances can quickly download and apply the pre-built configuration, enabling faster scale-out responses to demand spikes.
- **Typical Nix deployment:** The time required for evaluation and building on each new instance can introduce significant delays in auto-scaling responsiveness. This lag may result in suboptimal resource utilization during demand fluctuations and could impact application performance during scale-out events.

In summary, applying a fully evaluated NixOS closure from [FlakeHub](https://flakehub.com) during deployments ensures that the exact same configuration is deployed every time, as the closure is a fixed, immutable artifact.
It also leads to faster deployments (and rollback *when required*) by pre-evaluating and pre-building the NixOS configuration, thus offloading the heavy lifting from the deployment phase to CI/CD.
